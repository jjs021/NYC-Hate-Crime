Analysis of NYC Hate Crime Data
I downloaded the hate crime data from NYC Open Data site: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

I analyzed the hate crime data by victims demography, crime types.  
I discovered that although the Jewish people has the most likely to experience hate crimes, the majority of attacks were related to property thefts. 
The most of the physical attacks were targeted to Asians and Gay people.
